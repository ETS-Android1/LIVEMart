# Introduction
As a part of our course requirements for Object Oriented Programming, we were required to develop an application
(Android/Web based/Stand-alone) for e-marketing that connects customers (individuals who shop
for home purpose) to retailers (people dealing with multiple items who stores items in large
quantities) and retailers to wholesalers (warehouse maintaining people) with the below mentioned
mandatory functionalities. <br/><br/>Though we were given the freedom to choose any OOP language with any framework ,we decided to build an Android Mobile Application as we wanted to try something new. Some of us had experience in HTML , but the idea of creating a mobile application was rather more appealing to us. The reason why we chose Java over Kotlin was because of the abundance of resources available online and it was the language chosen for the course content. 

Can this project be done in Kotlin?<br/><br/>
Yes, as we came closer towards completing the project, we realized that with a quick few searches, we could've developed the application in Kotlin too. It would've taken us a few more days to understand the syntax and replicate the ideas implemented in Java but given the time constraints , Java was the more viable option.

# Usage
Now that you've reached this heading, you must be interested in developing an android application with a similar problem statement or you're just curious as to how we implemented our ideas.<br/><br/>
Our project was divided into 5 modules with different funtionalities and purposes. At every module, I have provided resources that can help you build a similar application. You can watch the videos to understand the concept and use our code for reference.
